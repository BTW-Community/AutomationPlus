Version 1.0.0
[list]
[*]Added the stonecutter, which functions like the saw but for stone-based blocks. It is crafted like the saw but with diamond ingots, a lubricated belt, and stone brick items instead of planks. Note that they will break if used on anything not stone-based.
[*]Added the lubricated belt, made with a belt and tallow in a stoked cauldron.
[*]Added the loom as a non-functional block. Functionality will be added at a later date. It is crafted with 2 hemp fiber and slats in the top row, 4 wood sidings on the sides, with a belt and gear in the center.
[*]Added the ability to grind blaze rods into powder in a millstone.
[*]Added the vessel of the dragon to the creative menu.
[*]Added (re-enabled) the comparator from vanilla. It is crafted with 3 stone bricks in a line below a redstone eye, which has 3 redstone torches around it (same shape as vanilla recipe).
[*]Added the ability for the comparator to read from BTW inventories, which include the block dispenser, hopper, pulley, millstone, cauldron, and crucible.
[*]Added the ability for the comparator to read the amount of xp present in the vessel of the dragon.
[*]Added the ability to filter wheat into wheat seeds and straw with a hopper using a wicker filter.
[*]Changed the redstone eye recipe to use only a single row of lapis and to be made in a normal crafting grid.
[*]Fixed a BTW issue where glowing detector logic was in the crafting menu in place of the detector block.
