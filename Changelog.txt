[*]Added the stonecutter, which functions like the saw but for stone-based blocks. It is crafted like the saw but with diamond ingots, a lubricated belt, and stone brick items instead of planks. Note that they will break if used on anything not stone-based, which includes anyhing wooden.
[*]Added the lubricated belt, made with a belt and tallow in a stoked cauldron.
[*]Re-enabled the comparator from vanilla. It can be crafted with the vanilla recipe shape, replacing the stone with stone brick items and the quartz with a redstone eye.
