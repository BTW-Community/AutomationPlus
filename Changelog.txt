Version 1.0.0
[list]
[*]Added the stonecutter, which functions like the saw but for stone-based blocks. It is crafted like the saw but with diamond ingots, a lubricated belt, and stone brick items instead of planks. Note that they will break if used on anything not stone-based, which includes anything wooden.
[*]Added the lubricated belt, made with a belt and tallow in a stoked cauldron.
[*]Added the ability to grind blaze rods into powder in a millstone.
[*]Re-enabled the comparator from vanilla. It is crafted with 3 stone bricks in a line below a redstone eye, which has 3 redstone torches around it (same shape as vanilla recipe).
